# README Generator

## Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a README generator. Using `Node.js`, `NPM Inquirer`, and `Javascript` I created a command-line application that takes user input and generates a [Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a seperate `Markdown` file. 

This is a very useful and simple application as it removes the tedium of creating a README for each of your projects and streamlines the process, letting you focus on more important tasks.
